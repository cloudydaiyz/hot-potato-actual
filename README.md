This project was taught as a Technical Project Workshop for the Association of Computer Scientists at the University of Texas at Austin. This project is complete, though small changes may be added in the future. You can find more information [here](https://github.com/UT-ABCS/tech-workshops).  <br />

This workshop will cover the concept of Git, GitHub, and basic GitHub commands. The goal of this project is to utilize a shared GitHub repository to replicate the game of Hot Potato while also learning about Git and GitHub. Each person has to update a file, git add, git commit, and git push the changes to the workshop branch. You can find the slides associated with this workshop at [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dGB2oIzAOJ1rFKQ3t8h0jFwCBC9I124MVJOdl0w0xso/edit?usp=sharing).  <br />
